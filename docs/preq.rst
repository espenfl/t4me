Prerequisites
=============

In its basic form T4ME only need the following
dependency:

- `Spglib <https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_.
  This can be installed with

::

   pip install spglib

Additional optional dependencies include:

- `Spglib <https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_,
  A custom interface to Spglib to enable tetrahedron integration.
- `GeometricTools <https://www.geometrictools.com/>`_
  (use Wildmagic 5.14).
  Used to interpolate band structure data, for instance by offering Akima interpolation.
