Running tests
=============

Several tests are included, which can be used to test the installation,
but more importantly assist in verify development steps.

Currently only basic functionality is tested and developers
are encouraged to write tests for any added functionality.

Tests can be run by setting the ``run_tests`` in the general parameter file,
typically the file :file:`param.yml`.
