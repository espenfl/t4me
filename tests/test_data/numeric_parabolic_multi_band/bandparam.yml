# The format follows normal YAML conventions, one entry
# per band. If many bands are used one can use a range,
# e.g. Band X-Y: to set the same parameters for bands X
# to Y. Or if one would want to set the same parameters
# for all bands one should use Band 1-: All this is quite
# usefull when reading data from a full-band calculation
# of some sort.
#
# Remember to use two spaces indent after each Band
# entry
#
# For select_scattering, set element to 1 to include
# scattering, 0 otherwise currently the following
# scattering mechanisms have been implemented:
# 1 - elastic acoustic phonon scattering from def. pot.
# 2 - non-polar optical phonon scattering
# 3 - intervalley phonon scattering
# 4 - polar optical phonon scattering
# 5 - piezoelectric phonon scattering
# 6 - ionized impurity scattering (Brooks-Herring)
# 7 - ionized impority scattering (Conwell-Weiskopf)
# 8 - alloy scattering
# 9-11 - empty slots
# 12 - constant (with respect to energy) scattering
#
# If one does not use the analytic (parabolic)
# scattering models and instead use the density of
# states to generate the scattering rate, then only
# the first four and the last have been implemented
# (currently only the first and last have been tested)
